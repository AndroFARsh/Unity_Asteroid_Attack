# Unity Asteroid Attack

This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids, created solely for academic purposes.

To build this project, I used Unity as the engine and VContainer as the dependency injection library. The overall architecture was inspired by the <a href="https://lms.k-syndicate.school/ecs/">K-Syndicate ECS course</a>.

Try the game using the <a href="https://androfarsh.github.io/Unity_Asteroid_Attack/">Unity Asteroid Attack</a> link.
